# Excess Express

This is our hackathon project, where we will build a middleman platform to allow chains to donate excess food to maller businesses.

Website Mission: We recognized that Franchises habitually dispose of excess food, which these franchises in question could have recycled. Our solution, our site, acts as a middleman, putting small businesses that may have a shortage of supplies in connection with big franchises that have excess, feeding two birds with one scone.

Website Value: The website allows smaller, diverse businesses to compete with larger franchisees sustainably. We value this business and the opportunity our website affords them to use this untapped capital to their advantage.

### Built With:
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)

### Requirements:

* Clone repo using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/Excess-express`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Run `python main.py` to tart
* `cd client` to access the Vue package, and run `npm run dev` to start vite server for Vue, which should be on port `5173`.

### Notes
I do have a Dockerfile for my go part of this project, but including causes the application to use it to deploy instead of pushes to github for whatever reason, so I'm not including it for now.
